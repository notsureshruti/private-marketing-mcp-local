MARKETING MEMORY

I am a systems-first marketer.
I believe marketing should be built like an operating system, not random campaigns.
I focus on clarity, execution speed, and reducing manual effort using technology.
I avoid vanity metrics, random trends, and marketing without a clear goal.
Success is defined by reduced decision-making effort and real business outcomes.
