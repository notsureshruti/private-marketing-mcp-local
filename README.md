## In simple terms

This project helps you use AI without losing control of your thinking.

Instead of asking AI random questions and getting generic advice, you first write down:
- what you believe (strategy),
- who you are building for (context),
- what you should avoid (rules).

The AI is then allowed to answer **only** using what you wrote.
If something is not defined, it refuses to guess.

Think of it like giving AI your brain — but on your terms.
## Why this is useful

Most people use AI like a brainstorming partner.
That sounds helpful, but it often leads to:
- inconsistent decisions,
- changing opinions every day,
- advice that sounds good but doesn’t fit your situation.

This system is useful because it does the opposite.

It helps you:
- stay consistent with your own thinking,
- avoid repeating bad decisions,
- reduce mental overload,
- use AI as a reasoning partner instead of a suggestion machine.

This makes it useful not just for marketing, but for any role that involves frequent decisions.
## Who this is for (and who it is not)

This is for people who:
- make frequent decisions,
- care about consistency,
- want AI to respect their thinking,
- prefer clarity over constant new ideas.

This is not for people who:
- want instant answers without context,
- expect AI to think for them,
- are only looking for creative inspiration,
- want “growth hacks” or shortcuts.


# Private Marketing MCP (Local)

A local, privacy-first Marketing MCP that grounds AI in real context, strategy, and decision rules.

This system turns your **strategy, ICP, decisions, and campaigns** into structured memory so a local LLM can reason **only from your thinking — not generic advice**.

---

## What this is

Private Marketing MCP (Local) is a **local-first marketing operating system**.

It lets you:
- Store strategy as files (not prompts)
- Load that context into a local LLM
- Ask questions and make decisions based ONLY on your data
- Keep everything private and offline

No SaaS.  
No dashboards.  
No data leaving your machine.

## How it works (high level)

1. You write strategy files (ICP, core strategy, decisions, campaigns)
2. A script converts them into structured memory
3. A local LLM (via Ollama) loads that memory
4. You ask questions
5. Answers are grounded ONLY in your files
